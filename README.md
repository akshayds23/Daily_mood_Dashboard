# 🧘‍♂️ Daily Mood & Productivity Dashboard

A automated personal mood tracker and productivity logger — built with Python for data generation and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the UI. The project uses GitHub Actions to update data daily and serves a static dashboard from `docs/` (no Streamlit required).

## 🚀 How it works

1. A scheduled GitHub Action runs daily and:
   - Generates (or appends) a mood & productivity entry to `log.md`.
   - Generates the plots (`mood_trend.png`, `mood_calendar.png`) using Python.
   - Copies the latest assets to `docs/`.
2. `docs/dashboard.html` is a small static UI written in HTML/CSS/JS that reads the images and `log.md` to render charts and panels. No Streamlit or other server is required.

---

## 📦 Setup & run locally

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayds23/daily_mood_dashboard_python.git
cd daily-mood-dashboard
```

2. (Optional) Create a venv and install Python deps for generating plots:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install matplotlib pandas calplot
```

3. Generate the plots locally:

```bash
python plots/generate_plot.py
python plots/generate_calendar.py
```

4. Open the static dashboard in `docs/dashboard.html` with any browser.

---

## 📤 Deploy with GitHub Pages

The included GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update.yml`) copies the generated `docs/` files and pushes them to GitHub Pages. After enabling GitHub Pages for the repository, the dashboard will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/dashboard.html`.

---

## Notes & troubleshooting

- This project intentionally uses a static HTML/JS UI so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages — no Streamlit or Python web server required.
- If plots look blank, ensure `log.md` contains entries and re-run the generate scripts.
- If the calendar heatmap isn't up-to-date, re-run `generate_calendar.py` and confirm `mood_calendar.png` was updated in `docs/`.
